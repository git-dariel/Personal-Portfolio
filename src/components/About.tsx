          I'm <span className="font-bold"> Dariel Avila</span>, your friendly
          neighborhood aspiring software engineer with a knack for turning web
          and mobile development into digital magic. As a full-stack developer,
          I'm not just about writing code – I'm all about crafting seamless and
          dazzling user experiences.

        <p className=" sm:px-12 py-2 text-gray-300">
          I honed my skills as a backend developer at Quezelco Company, where I
          had the fantastic opportunity to be part of the IT dream team. Working
          on the nitty-gritty of backend systems, I've become your go-to person
          for building robust and scalable solutions.

        <p className=" sm:px-12 py-2 text-gray-300">
          But hey, it's not just about the code for me. I'm on a perpetual
          learning spree, staying ahead of the tech curve and soaking in all the
          cool innovations. Collaborative projects are my playground, and I
          thrive in teams where creativity and excellence collide.

        <p className=" sm:px-12 py-2 text-gray-300">
          So why me? Because I'm not just in it for the tech; I'm in it to make
          a mark. If you're looking for a developer with passion, skill, and a
